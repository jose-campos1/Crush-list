# Crush-listAPP

This project has a firebase real time database that allows to write and read, data add or delete it on real time, its made in Angular and it was a real work to make it appear on the [githubpages](https://jose-campos1.github.io/Crush-list/dist/login)because it happens to be some specific data management at the [build level](https://github.com/jose-campos1/Crush-list/blob/master/package.json) chech merge and deploy at the bottom...

The Angular project, github pages cli, ngh, and firebase deploy, creation of [Tokens](https://github.com/jose-campos1/Crush-list/blob/master/src/app/data.services.ts),source builders, build and deploy on GitHub Actions it's finally merged with the [database](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/data-base1-8cf55/database/data-base1-8cf55-default-rtdb/data?hl=es) and its working properly.
 
note: As i have to keep working on other projets i will be adding the missing documentation hoping to help someone with this same issues, because its not clear how to make work a github page with angular firebase database capable of login, register, and add data to the web from here.

You can register on the list and add yours, it's simple to do ðŸ˜‰
