# Crush-list ❣

<h3 align="center">This project has a firebase real time database that allows to write and read, data add or delete it on real time, its made in Angular and it was a real work to make it appear on the github pages because it happens to be some specific data management at the build level of the Angular project, github pages cli, ngh, and firebase deploy, creation of tokens, source builders, build and deploy on GitHub Actions, but its finally merged with the database and its working properly its a hard process to document more than the build... and as i have to keep working on other projets i will be adding the missing documentation hoping to help someone with this same issues, because its not clear how to make work a github page with angular firebase database capable of login, register, and add data to the web from here</h3>
