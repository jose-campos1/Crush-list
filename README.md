# Crush-list ❣

<h3 align="center">This project has a firebase real time database that allows to write and read, data add or delete it on real time, its made in Angular and it was a real work to make it appear on the github pages because it happens to be some specific data management at the build level of the angular projec, github pages (cli , ngh , and firebase deploy), but its finally merged with the database and its working properly.</h3>
  
<h4 align="center">You can register on the list and add yours, it's simple to do 😉</h4>

<p align= "center" >**it was not designed to be a crush-list but its the first use as a test**</p>
