# Crush-list

this project has a firebase real time database that allows to write and reat data add or delete it on real time, its made in angular and was a real work to make it appear on the git pages because it happens to be some specific data management at the build level of the angular projec, github pages (cli , ngh , and firebase deploy), but its finally merged with the database and its working properly.

it was not designed to be a crush-list but its the first use as a test.
