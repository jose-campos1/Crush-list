note: As i have to keep working on other projets i will be adding the missing documentation hoping to help someone with this same issues, because its not clear how to make work a github page with angular firebase database capable of login, register, and add data to the web from here.

You can register on the list and add yours, it's simple to do ðŸ˜‰
